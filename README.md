Revenue Operations Portfolio
Daniel S. Im

Overview
  I began in sales and transitioned into Revenue Operations by repeatedly identifying structural friction inside our sales organization and building systems to fix it. 
  Without a formal engineering background, I independently designed and implemented governance frameworks, workflow automations, reporting infrastructure, and data cleanup initiatives. For more technical builds, I leveraged ChatGPT to help generate logic and structure, then personally implemented, tested, and iterated until production-ready.
My work spans:
  Sales process governance
  Workflow automation (Salesforce + Sheets)
  CRM data integrity
  Performance reporting systems
  Cross-functional execution with Sales, Marketing, IT, and HR

1. Revenue Performance Infrastructure Redesign

Problem
Performance tracking relied on manual inputs with inconsistent definitions and limited executive visibility.

Action
Redesigned reporting architecture. Standardized quota definitions, aligned Salesforce data integrity with IT, and built a structured reporting system using Supabase with manager input workflows and executive dashboards.

Impact
Created a trusted single source of truth for performance reporting. Reduced manual overhead and supported sustained quota attainment between 98%–124%, including 124% after a 40% increase.

2. CRM Data Enrichment Initiative (~9,000 Accounts)

Problem
Missing and inconsistent firmographic data reduced segmentation accuracy and reporting reliability.

Action
Exported, normalized, and mapped account data by ID. Coordinated structured re-import to preserve integrity and eliminate duplication.

Impact
Improved targeting precision, segmentation clarity, and CRM data confidence across revenue teams.

-----

3. SDR Governance & Rules of Engagement

Problem
Unclear ownership across leads and accounts caused rep conflict and inconsistent outreach.

Action
Designed and implemented formal Rules of Engagement and accountability frameworks in partnership with leadership and HR.

Impact
Reduced ownership disputes and established enforceable governance standards.

-----

4. Cross-Sell Outreach Governance System

Problem
No structured ownership model for cross-product outreach, creating duplicate contact risk.

Action
Built a centralized allocation and routing system with product segmentation and rep-level controls.

Impact
Eliminated duplicate outreach and formalized cross-sell governance.

-----

5. Salesforce Workflow Automation – Demo Capture

Problem
Manual demo data entry created reporting gaps and inconsistent attribution.

Action
Implemented Record-Triggered Flows to auto-populate required fields upon demo booking.

Impact
Improved data accuracy and eliminated manual process dependency.

-----

6. Real-Time Demo Booking Notifications

Problem
Leadership lacked immediate visibility into booked demos.

Action
Built event-triggered automation scoped to specific record types to send real-time notifications while preventing noise.

Impact
Improved operational visibility and reduced manual monitoring.
